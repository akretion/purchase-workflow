Based on native module ``purchase_requisition``, this module helps to visualize all the "Bids" (``purchase.order``) filled by the suppliers answering a "Call for Tender" (``purchase.requisition``).

In the same screen, the user can easily **select the best Purchase Order Lines for each product**. The Purchase Orders with no selected lines will be canceled while the others will be confirmed.

The not-selected lines in a confirmed PO will be deactivated and not deleted, facilitating the "Purchase Agreement reset" if needed.
