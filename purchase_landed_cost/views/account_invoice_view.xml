                  <!-- TODO : Improve this button linking an invoice_line to a Cost Distribution Expense
                        1. A more explicit name should be "Link Invoice Line to Cost Distribution Expense"
                        2. On clicking, open a pop-up with the following steps :
                            a. Choose the Invoice Line to link
                            b. Choose the Cost Distribution with the Expense to be linked
                            c. Display the selected Cost Distribution Expenses and allows to :
                                - create a new expense
                                - or link the selected invoice line to an existing Expense linked with no Invoice Line already
                                - or change the actual Invoice Line linked to an Expense
                            d. When clicking on "Link Invoice Line", display in the Invoice M2M fields "expense_line_ids"
                            all the invoice's Invoice Lines linked to some Cost Distribution Expenses
